                    <strong>Marshall Chassis Design</strong> – Our smaller models use a fully-welded channel chassis that provides unmatched strength while keeping weight down. Our S/85 and S/10 models use a square chassis configuration to improve stability and reduce flexing when loading. In addition our S/10 model also benefits from a further strengthened chassis, which employs an 8mm thick reinforcing plate over the front of the chassis members to provide incredible rigidity.</div>

                    <strong>Paint Finish</strong> – Since November 2011 we have shot-blasted, this is acknowledged in the paint industry as the best possible method for preparing steel for painting. The shot-blasting creates a profile for the paint to adhere to, improving adhesion and in turn the protection offered to the steel. Our five man team of trained sprayers then use the latest spraying equipment to finish our products with a dual layer paint finish. Every machine is finished with 80 microns of high-build primer and 50 microns of gloss polyurethane; this combination provides excellent protection and a high-quality finish.</div>

            <li>Large capacity</li>
            <li>Fully welded construction eliminates rust traps</li>
            <li>Fixed headboard (ensures a rigid body)</li>
            <li>Fully braced hinge points (eliminates cracking of material)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>The smallest model of trailer we produce is the S/1 drop side trailer. It has been designed to match small, compact tractors for use in the groundcare and leisure sectors. Despite being the entry-level model the entire trailer is built using CNC controlled machines to guarantee strength and finish.</p>
        <p>The drop side design provides excellent versatility, allowing the trailer to be used as a flat-bed or a proper trailer. This drastically increases the jobs this trailer can be used for, whether it is moving pallets, small machines, sand or grass; it really can handle all jobs. The S/1 also has the option of mesh sides, which further improves its versatility and makes it an ideal product for the leisure industry.</p>
        <p>The body of the S/1 is built from 2.5mm steel, which is the perfect blend between strength and manageability; the sides still have to be easily removable. The hinge points for the sides are also reinforced to prevent cracking or twisting under heavy loads. To improve rigidity the trailer also has a fixed headboard, reducing flexing during loading and transport.</p>
        <p>The trailer chassis utilies our tried and tested design developed over 60 years of trailer manufacturing, and provides exceptional strength. The S/1 is also fully-equipped with a hydraulic tipping ram, improving its efficiency and practicality.</p>
        <p>The result of all these features and construction standards, is a heavy-duty drop-side trailer that is strong, practical and well finished.</p>
